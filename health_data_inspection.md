## Business Requirement:

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for the insight shared on the DVD Movie Rental dataset, your findings helped the senior executives to decide what to do next.

Could you please take a look at the `User_logs data` in the Health schema and let me know what you find. I will appreciate if I can get it before noon tomorrow for review since the meeting with the client is scheduled for Monday. Thank you

Kind Regards,
Danny Ma.   


**Query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM health.user_logs
LIMIT 10;
```

The snapshot of the first 10 rows showed that the `Health.user_logs` table has 6 columns. To know the total record count on this table, I ran the following query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM health.user_logs;
```
This showed that there are **43,891** records in the table. It will be okay to know the unique `id` values there are in this dataset. This will give us a feel of how many unique users there are whilst we continue getting a better picture of the dataset. We get this by running the following query,

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM health.user_logs;
```
The query showed that there are **554** unique id values in the `Health.user_logs` table. Let inspect the `measure` column in the table and take a look at the most frequent values within this column. See the query below,

```sql
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency,
  ROUND(
    100 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (),
    2
  ) AS percentage
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY measure
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```
|measure|frequency|percentage|
|:----|:----|:----|
|blood_glucose|38692|88.15|
|weight|2782|6.34|
|blood_pressure|2417|5.51|

As seen in the table above, most of the `measure` value are for `blood_glucose`. It will be nice if we look at the `id` column as well,

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency,
  ROUND(
    100 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (),
    2
  ) AS percentage
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
|id|frequency|percentage|
|:----|:----|:----|
|054250c692e07a9fa9e62e345231df4b54ff435d|22325|50.86|
|0f7b13f3f0512e6546b8d2c0d56e564a2408536a|1589|3.62|
|ee653a96022cc3878e76d196b1667d95beca2db6|1235|2.81|
|abc634a555bbba7d6d6584171fdfa206ebf6c9a0|1212|2.76|
|576fdb528e5004f733912fae3020e7d322dbc31a|1018|2.32|
|87be2f14a5550389cb2cba03b3329c54c993f7d2|747|1.70|
|46d921f1111a1d1ad5dd6eb6e4d0533ab61907c9|651|1.48|
|fba135f6a50a2e3f371e47f943b025705f9d9617|633|1.44|
|d696925de5e9297694ef32a1c9871f3629bec7e5|597|1.36|
|6c2f9a8372dac248192c50219c97f9087ab778ba|582|1.33|

The result above showed that about 51% of the total records are from one  `id` or one user. Let's also take a quick look at the most frequent values for each column:

### Measure_value column
```sql
SELECT
  measure_value,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY measure_value
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
|measure_value|frequency|
|:----|:----|
|0|572|
|401|433|
|117|390|
|118|346|
|123|342|
|122|331|
|126|326|
|120|323|
|128|319|
|115|319|

## Systolic
```sql
SELECT
  systolic,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
|systolic|frequency|
|:----|:----|
| |26023|
|0|15451|
|120|71|
|123|70|
|128|66|
|127|64|
|130|60|
|119|60|
|135|57|
|124|55|

There seems to me a lot of nulls..

### Diastolic
```sql
SELECT
  diastolic,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
|diastolic|frequency|
|:----|:----|
| |26023|
|0|15449|
|80|156|
|79|124|
|81|119|
|78|110|
|77|109|
|73|109|
|83|106|
|76|102|

This also contain a lot of null values.

Noticed how many 0 values there were for the `measure_value` field and `null` values for both `systolic` and `diastolic` columns? It will be best to further inspect the rows a bit further to check if this only happens for certain `measure` values when the condition measure_value = 0 is met and the systolic and diastolic columns are null.

```sql
SELECT 
  measure,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure_value = 0
GROUP BY measure
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```
|measure|frequency|
|:----|:----|
|blood_pressure|562|
|blood_glucose|8|
|weight|2|

Let's also compare this with the overall frequency percentage calculated earlier:

|measure|frequency|percentage|
|:----|:----|:----|
|blood_glucose|38692|88.15|
|weight|2782|6.34|
|blood_pressure|2417|5.51|

Even though the `measure= blood_pressure` is just about 5.51% of the total records, it's also the measure with most of the `measure_value = 0`. Let's filter with these two conditions,

```sql
SELECT *
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure_value = 0
AND measure = 'blood_pressure';
```
|id|log_date|measure|measure_value|systolic|diastolic|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|

It appears that when the blood pressure is measured sometimes the `measure_value` field is empty and the relevant `systolic` and `diastolic` fields are recorded. It is okay to also look at what happened when the blood pressure is measured and the `measure_value` is not 0.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure_value != 0
AND measure = 'blood_pressure'
LIMIT 10;
```
|id|log_date|measure|measure_value|systolic|diastolic|

|abc634a555bbba7d6d6584171fdfa206ebf6c9a0|2020-03-09T00:00:00.000Z|blood_pressure|114|114|76|

It looks like that systolic value is sometimes being used at that measure_value and sometimes the measure_value is 0!

Letâ€™s finish this off by also looking at the null systolic and diastolic values in the same manner:
```sql
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(*)
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE systolic IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
|measure|count|
|:----|:----|
|weight|443|
|blood_glucose|25580|

This result confirms that systolic only has non-null records when measure = 'blood_pressure'

Can we confirm this is the fact for the diastolic column too?

```sql
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(*)
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE diastolic IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
|measure|count|
|:----|:----|
|weight|443|
|blood_glucose|25580|

Yes we can therefore confirm this!
